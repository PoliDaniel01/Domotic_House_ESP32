"""
Main script for the ESP32 board controlling the lights.

This script is responsible for:
- Controlling multiple lights connected to its GPIO pins.
- Handling physical button presses to toggle the lights.
- Connecting to Wi-Fi and an MQTT broker to receive commands and report state.
- Using interrupts for button handling to be more efficient than polling.
