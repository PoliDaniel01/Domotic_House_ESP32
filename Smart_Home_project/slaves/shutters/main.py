"""
Main script for the ESP32 board controlling the window shutters.

This script is responsible for:
- Controlling a motor to move shutters up and down.
- Handling physical button presses for manual control.
- Using interrupts for button handling for maximum efficiency.
- Using asynchronous tasks to manage motor run-time without blocking.
- Communicating with the master board via MQTT to receive commands and report state.
