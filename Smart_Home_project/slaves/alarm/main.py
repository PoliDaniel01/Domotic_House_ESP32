"""
Main script for the ESP32 board managing the alarm system.

This script is responsible for:
- Monitoring sensor inputs (e.g., door/window contacts).
- Handling a physical reset button.
- Activating an indicator LED when the alarm is triggered.
- Using interrupts for all physical inputs for efficient operation.
- Communicating with the master board via MQTT to be armed/disarmed and to report its state.
